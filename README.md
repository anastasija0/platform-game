# Ninjas vs Zombies
This is a game I made in highschool Python using Pygame module. It's a platform game where you can fight against zombies by attacking them or jumping over them. That way you can gain points(and lives) and lose them.

This is still unfinished game I wish to go back to and fix-up any bugs.
